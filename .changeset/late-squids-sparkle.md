The Astro VS Code extension and language server are now powered by Volar (https://volarjs.github.io/)! This updates massively improve performance and add numerous features such as selection ranges, document highlights, support for intellisense on inline JavaScript, CodeLens helper for `Astro.glob` and more.

In the background, this update means that we now have to maintain a lot less code ourselves, which means we'll be able to dedicate more time to offering fun, Astro-specific features instead of maintaining core features.
